# Cerberus

Multi-agent AI PR review council. Five parallel reviewers. Single council verdict gates merge.

## Reviewers
- APOLLO: correctness + logic (find the bug)
- ATHENA: architecture + design (zoom out)
- SENTINEL: security + threat model (think like an attacker)
- VULCAN: performance + scalability (think at runtime)
- ARTEMIS: maintainability + DX (think like next developer)

## Key Paths
- config: `.github/cerberus/config.yml`
- agents: `.github/cerberus/agents/`
- system prompts: `.github/cerberus/agents/*-prompt.md`
- scripts: `.github/cerberus/scripts/`
- templates: `.github/cerberus/templates/review-prompt.md`
- workflow: `.github/workflows/cerberus.yml`

## Output Schema (Reviewer JSON)
Each reviewer ends with a JSON block in ```json fences.

Required fields:
- reviewer, perspective, verdict, confidence, summary
- findings[] with severity/category/file/line/title/description/suggestion
- stats with files_reviewed, files_with_issues, critical, major, minor, info

Verdict rules:
- FAIL: any critical OR 2+ major
- WARN: exactly 1 major OR 3+ minor
- PASS: otherwise

## Override Protocol

```
/council override sha=<sha>
reason: <justification for overriding>
```

Rules:
- reason required (line after command, or `reason:` prefix)
- sha must be 7-40 hex chars and match current HEAD
- actor policy is global (`override.actor` in config.yml), not per-reviewer
